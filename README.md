## About This Portfolio
In June 2019 I embarked on a journey to change careers from a UI/UX Designer to a Full Stack Web Developer. After 10 years of designing I thought it was time to take the next step in to building the things I've created. This portfolio is a collection of some of my favorite projects to date. They showcase a variety of my new found skill set including **Javascript, Less, Sass, HTML, React and Node**.

This portfolio is built using React.js and is deployed through Netlify.

## About Me
Growing up I knew one thing, I wanted to be Paramedic and a Graphic Designer. During my senior year in high school, I took the steps to join life in public service and began taking EMT classes in the evenings at the local fire station. It was an extra 4 hours or so a night of studying but I didn't care. I turned 18 in March of my senior year and was hired in October for my first EMS job. I was officially on track to the career I dreamed about.

A life working in EMS yields significant downtime so I started to take on more responsibilities within the community. Throughout that time I was a volunteer firefighter, photographer for the Greencastle Fire Department and a 911 dispatcher. In the midst of all of that, I would take on freelance design work for the various agencies I worked with. After 8 years of working in public service, I changed careers to follow my second passion, and in 2012 I packed my bags and moved to Indianapolis, IN for my first full-time position as a Graphic Designer.

It's been a wild ride and an experience I wouldn't change for the world. Presently my career path has led me to a field of web development which is where I find myself today. I am currently a Full-Time Graphic Designer and UI/UX Designer for Slyfox Creative in Greenwood, IN and I also attend Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development Class where I am learning the fundamental tools for a career in software development. My current skill set includes HTML5 CSS3, Less, JavaScript & React. I am also an expert in the Adobe Creative Software Suite including, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, and Dimension.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing Ice Hockey at my local hockey rink where I've been the captain of my hockey team for 7 years. I also enjoy cooking barbeque on my Big Green Egg.

Other small interesting tidbits about myself:
• I've got a second-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
• I had a brief career as a TV personality on the television show Paranormal State The New Class
