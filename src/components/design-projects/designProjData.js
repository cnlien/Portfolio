The plane was something he'd been using as a stamp so I decided to incorporate it as the center piece of the logo. The colors were chosen because most of his work is finished naturally to bring out the colors and grain of the wood. The saw blade is an optional feature that can be removed but offers a type of border should the design need to be displayed with an all white background.",
